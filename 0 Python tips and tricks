Point 1:

The main difference between xrange() and the built-in range() function in Python 3 is that xrange() returns a generator object that produces each integer on demand, rather than creating a full list of integers in memory. 
This can save memory in situations where a large range of numbers is being generated.

Point 2:

Python ord() function returns the Unicode code from a given character
Example ord(a) = 97

Point 3:

Generate a value and its index

num_list = [int(c) for c in str(num)]
last_index = {n:i for i, n in enumerate(num_list)}


input 2736
{2: 0, 7: 1, 3: 2, 6: 3}

Point 4:

Sort an array based on the length of the values in the array

for word in sorted(words, key=len):

Point 5:

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination to solve a computational problem. It incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") when it determines that the candidate cannot lead to the solution.
