Point 1:

The main difference between xrange() and the built-in range() function in Python 3 is that xrange() returns a generator object that produces each integer on demand, rather than creating a full list of integers in memory. 
This can save memory in situations where a large range of numbers is being generated.

Point 2:

Python ord() function returns the Unicode code from a given character
Example ord(a) = 97
